## INITIAL DESIGN PLAN:

Design a plan which meets the computational requirements to solve the problem. Your plan does not need to be syntactically correct. It needs to capture the flow of logic in a human readable format.

For example:
1. Capture user input about how many balls they want to put in the basket
2. Use a conditional to see if the number is greater than 15
3. ...

## IMPLEMENTATIONS:

A list in bullet form of each function you created, and what is each functionâ€™s purpose.

Replace this text and the text above with your design. Do this section before you begin coding.

## TESTING:

An overview of what values you felt needed testing, and why.

Replace this text and the text above with your design. Do this section before you begin coding.

## ERRORS:

A list in bullet form of all known errors and deficiencies in your implementation.

Replace this text and the text above with your design. Do this section while you are coding and notice errors. Some you may even fix before your finished!

## SUMMARY:

A brief summary description of the design and implementation, including how much your initial design plan evolved, the final result you achieved, and the amount of time you spent as a programmer in accomplishing these results. This should be no more than two paragraphs. Consider this like a report of what you did.

Replace this text and the text above with your design. Do this section after you finish coding.

## COMMENTS:

A paragraph or so of your own comments on and reactions to this assignment. Consider this like a reflection.
